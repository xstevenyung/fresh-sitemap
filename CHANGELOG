This project was forked and continued from https://github.com/xstevenyung/fresh-seo

v 1.0.2  (Dec 11, 2024)
  Resolved issue: https://github.com/xstevenyung/fresh-seo/issues/27
  Now works with Deno 2.0+

  `save()` function uncommented and implemented: https://github.com/xstevenyung/fresh-seo/blob/main/src/sitemap.ts#L124

  Added new `freshSEOPlugin()` options:
    - `static: true`: allows to save sitemap.xml as file into `staticDir`, omitting route-level generation
    - while `static: true`, `deno task build` will also generate sitemap.xml file (`buildStart()` hook added)

  Resolved issue with dynamic routes on folder level: https://github.com/xstevenyung/fresh-seo/issues/28

  Tests added:
  - `Deno.test("Generate static sitemap.xml file")`
